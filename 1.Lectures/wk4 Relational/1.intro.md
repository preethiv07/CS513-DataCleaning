# Lecture: Introduction to Relational Model and Queries

## ✅ Summary

This lecture transitions from syntactic data cleaning (with OpenRefine) to **logic-based data integrity checking** using the **relational model**. It introduces foundational concepts in relational databases, focusing on how **relational queries** can be used to detect violations that span across multiple columns or tables.

Key topics include:
- Overview of the **relational model** and **query languages**
- Importance of **logical constraints** beyond column-level cleaning
- Introduction to **Datalog** and its connection to SQL
- Understanding **denial constraints** and logical representations of integrity rules

By the end of this module, you'll understand how relational logic can be used for **multi-column and multi-table integrity checking**, setting the stage for future use of SQL.

## 📚 Details

### 🔸 Recap: Why This Matters

- Previously, we used **OpenRefine** for cleaning individual columns via normalization.
- But real-world data issues often span:
  - Multiple columns (e.g., `birth_date < death_date`)
  - Multiple tables (e.g., foreign keys not matching)

→ Enter: the **relational model** and **logical integrity constraints**

---

### 🔸 What You’ll Learn This Week

- The **Relational Model**
  - A formal model for organizing structured data
- **Relational Schema**
  - Describes the structure (column names and types)
- **Database Instance**
  - The actual data contained in tables
- **Query Languages**
  - Tools to explore and enforce relationships in the data

---

### 🔸 Why Logic-Based Cleaning?

- Pattern-based cleaning (e.g., regex) is great for syntax
- But **logical errors** need rules like:
  - “If column A is filled, column B must also be filled”
  - “A student cannot be enrolled in two conflicting courses”

These checks can’t be done with regex — they require logic.

---

### 🔸 Datalog: Clean, Logical, Educational

- You’ll start with **Datalog**, a minimal logic-based language
- Why Datalog first?
  - It exposes the **logical core** of data constraints clearly
  - SQL hides the logic in syntax — Datalog keeps it pure

---

### 🔸 Assignments and Goals

- Write **simple relational queries** in Datalog
- Learn to express **integrity constraints** as **denial queries**:
  - Denial queries say “this condition must never be true”
  - Example: “It must never happen that a person is both ‘alive’ and has a ‘death_date’ filled”

→ This exercise helps you **think logically** about data relationships

---

### 🔸 What Comes Next

- Later, the course will move into **SQL**
  - SQL is practical and widely used
  - But it mixes logic and syntax, making it harder to see structure
- By learning Datalog first, you build a solid logical foundation
