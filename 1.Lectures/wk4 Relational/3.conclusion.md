# Lecture: Conclusion – Relational Model & Querying

## ✅ Summary

This wrap-up consolidates the week's learning on the **relational model**, emphasizing its foundation in **predicate logic** and the use of **query languages** like **Datalog** and **SQL** to enforce data integrity. The focus shifted from syntactic column-level cleaning to **semantic integrity constraints** that span multiple columns and tables.

Key takeaways:
- The relational model uses **tables (relations)** with clearly defined **schemas**
- Multiple query languages exist (SQL, Datalog, RA), but all share a **logical core**
- **Datalog** offers a concise, logic-first way to express constraints
- You will apply these ideas through **assignments**, using Datalog to detect cross-table issues
- SQL will be introduced next as a practical counterpart to Datalog for real-world applications

## 📚 Details

### 🔸 What We've Learned

- Relational databases organize data into **structured tables**
  - Rows = Tuples
  - Columns = Attributes
  - Schema = Table structure

- Relational data quality involves enforcing **integrity constraints**:
  - Uniqueness
  - Foreign keys
  - Logical consistency across records

---

### 🔸 Role of Query Languages

| Language | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Datalog** | Logic-first query language, great for expressing rules & constraints |
| **SQL**     | Industry-standard language for querying and enforcing ICs |
| **Relational Algebra & Calculus** | Theoretical underpinnings used in optimization and logic |

🧠 All are based on **First-Order Predicate Logic**

---

### 🔸 Datalog in Practice

- Used in assignments to:
  - Write **queries** that span tables
  - Express **denial constraints** (e.g., “no employee should report to themselves”)

- **Real-world usage** includes:
  - Graph/network data analysis
  - Online analytical processing (OLAP)
  - Specialized database systems

---

### 🔸 What's Next?

You’ll now build on these foundations by:
- Learning more about **integrity constraint checking**
- Applying **SQL** to detect and enforce data rules
- Comparing Datalog and SQL in practice

> 🧠 From isolated cells to interrelated logic — we now clean **data that makes sense**, not just looks clean.
