# Lecture: OpenRefine Demo – NYPL Menus Dataset

## ✅ Summary

This demo explores OpenRefine’s data cleaning capabilities on a **messier, crowd-sourced dataset** from the New York Public Library’s **historic menus collection**. Unlike the more curated USDA Farmers Market dataset, this dataset presents challenges like inconsistent spellings, punctuation, and uncertain labels. The session demonstrates how to:
- Import the dataset and create a project
- Apply whitespace cleaning and basic transformations
- Use **text facets** to inspect categorical values
- Apply **clustering** to unify variant entries
- Selectively merge data (e.g., filter out uncertain records using question marks)
- Undo changes using **operation history**

## 📚 Details

### 🔸 Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. 🗂️ Create New Project
- File used: `menu.csv` (downloaded from NYPL)
- Steps:
  - OpenRefine → Create Project → Upload file
  - Preview confirms correct parsing
  - Rename project to something meaningful like `"NYPL-Menus"`
  - ✅ Rows imported successfully and displayed for exploration

---

#### 2. 🧹 Clean Event Column: Basic Normalization

- Focus column: `event`
- Apply:
  - **Trim leading/trailing whitespace**
    - ✅ 3 cells updated
  - **Collapse consecutive whitespace**
    - ✅ 6 cells updated

🧠 Observation: Minor improvements, data relatively clean on syntactic level.

---

#### 3. 🔍 Apply Text Facet on `event` Column

- Reveals ~1,700 unique values among ~17,000 rows
- Top categories:
  - `DINNER` → 1,827 times
  - `BREAKFAST` → 830 times
  - `LUNCHEON`, etc.
- Reveals **variant spellings**: lowercase, extra punctuation, `"DINNER?"`

---

#### 4. 🔄 Cluster and Merge Variants

- Hit **Cluster** using `Fingerprint` method
- Identifies 14 variants of “Dinner” (e.g., `Dinner`, `DINNER?`, `DINNER.`)
- Suggested canonical form: `"DINNER"`
- ✅ Merge all variants → 2,148 rows normalized in a **mass edit**

---

#### 5. 📜 Inspect and Undo with Operation History

- Use **Undo/Redo** panel:
  - Review transformation steps
  - See mass edit for `event` column affecting 2,148 cells
- On closer inspection:
  - Questionable values like `"DINNER?"` may not be confidently classifiable

---

#### 6. 🧠 Strategy: Re-Cluster Only Certain Records

- Undo the previous clustering step
- Reapply **Text Facet** and use filter to browse only `event` entries related to `"Dinner"` cluster
- OpenRefine now shows subset: 2,148 matching rows
- Manually **select only confident variants** (e.g., `DINNER`, `Dinner`, not `DINNER?`)
- Re-cluster and merge selected values → ~2,134 rows confidently unified
- Leave uncertain entries (e.g., `DINNER?`) for later manual review or classification as `"Tentative Dinner"`

---

### 🔸 Key Takeaways

- OpenRefine allows fine-grained control:
  - You can selectively cluster and merge
  - Undo operations easily without starting over
- Provenance and **operation history** help track changes
- Ideal for:
  - Crowdsourced or inconsistent data
  - Repetitive normalization tasks

> 🧠 Good data cleaning is not about force-fitting everything — it's about knowing **when to merge** and **when to hold back**.
